## About

Hi there 👋

Over the past few years of trying and failed to be self-employed, I've learned a lot. This journey has been truly crazy! Evolving from a nerdy hacker behind the keyboard to an entrepreneurial problem solver.

My unique value lies in being both a deep-tech engineer and a business-minded professional: a rare combination that allows me to translate complex technology into real business impact and stakeholder value.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences. Feel free to get in touch or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t3bld/).
